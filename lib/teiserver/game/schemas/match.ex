  # Match
  The persisted storage of a game, for a guide on the lifecycle of a match please see the [`Match lifecycle guide`](match_lifecycle.html).

  ### Attributes

  * `:name` - The name of the lobby at the time the match started
  * `:tags` - The lobby tags at the time of the match starting
  * `:public?` - The public flag at time of the match starting
  * `:rated?` - The rated flag at time of the match starting, updated to false if the match is later decided to be unrated
  * `:game_name` - The game_name at time of the match starting, in most cases I expect game name to always be the same but this is in place to allow for multiple games to be run from a single server
  * `:game_version` - The game_version at time of the match starting
  * `:winning_team` - The ID of the winning team, set to nil in a draw
  * `:team_count` - The number of teams in the game
  * `:team_size` - The size of the largest team
  * `:processed?` - A flag showing if the match has had post-match processing
  * `:game_type` - A string indicating the type of game
  * `:lobby_opened_at` - The datetime the lobby was opened at or when the previous match completed
  * `:match_started_at` - The datetime the lobby swapped to being in progress, not the actual start time of the game itself
  * `:match_ended_at` - The datetime the match ended and the players were returned to the lobby, not the actual end time of the game itself
  * `:ended_normally?` - True if the match was ended in a normal manner, false if ended in an abnormal manner (e.g. crashed)
  * `:match_duration_seconds` - The duration of the game in seconds as indicated by the game host
  * `:host` - The user account hosting the lobby
