# Roadmap
This is not a rigid document, it is (especially at this stage) liable to change. Please feel free to raise an issue if you have requests related to this.

## v0.1 plan
* `v0.0.1` - Basic user features (Account)
* `v0.0.2` - Client features (Connections)
* `v0.0.3` - Chat and Messaging (Communication)
* `v0.0.4` - Lobbies (Lobby and Game)
* `v0.0.5` - Player relationships (Account and Community)
* `v0.0.6` - Logging and Event telemetry (Telemetry and Logging)
* `v0.0.7` - Moderation (Moderation and Account)
* `v0.0.8` - Parties (Community)
* `v0.0.9` - Site and User Settings (Settings)
* `v0.1` - Stability, tests and better examples on how to use it

At v0.1 I want the server to be in a state where developers can start to make use of it.
